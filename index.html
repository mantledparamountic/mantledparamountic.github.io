<h1>  Isaac Haïk Dunn </h1>
<p> Welcome to my website! </p>
<p> To do: Write a short introduction to thermoelectricity. Most of what can be found on thermoelectricity follows historical discoveries rather than focusing on the physics. As a result, newcomers to the field face a lot of confusions. For this reason, I think a short text explaining thermoelectricity and what people refer to when talking about it would be welcomed.</p>
<p> For fun: <a href="energy_flux_wire/Energy_flux_in_a_conducting_wire_more_formal.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a PDF document showing that the claim that "energy doesn't flow in wires" is false. This claim was popularized by several youtubers (some of them having high reach). A physical fact derived in the PDF I found interesting is that the wire cannot be in isothermal condition if its resistivity does not vanish and when there is a current going through it.</p>
