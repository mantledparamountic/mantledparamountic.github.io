It computes the electric field as well as the thermal gradient, enabling the computation and plot of the electric and thermal fluxes. It contains the generalization with thermoelectricity, which is enough to compute the efficiency of a device operating in a closed circuit. Tested the code by setting a vanishing Seebeck coefficient and by selecting current i/o surface same as thermal problem. This means I can trust my code and move on. Saved the file with ending \u0026#34;test_0_works.ipynb\u0026#34;. In this program, the \u0026#34;injected\u0026#34; current is the current produced by the voltage due to the temperature difference alone. This corresponds to attaching a wire to the material (although in this case we should consider Peltier heat). The implementation is as follows. First, the thermal problem (without current) is solved, which gives the voltage generated by the temperature gradient. Then the thermoelectricity problem is solved iteratively, where there is an electric current caused by the voltage of the previous iteration, until convergence in the solutions (temp and volt) is achieved. Dirichlet b.c. are used. The first iteration works as expected. Tested with S=30e-6 V/K, I = 0 A. The code produces the correct E field, temperature, voltage, grad T, grad V, Je and JQ values. \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; from mpi4py import MPI import gmsh from dolfinx.io import gmshio The cell below should be ran once (not necessarily every time).
